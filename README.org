* What is This?
This is one of my /many/ random projects that start from a "I wonder how hard this would be to do?"

The TL;DR is a parser for a basic language, but that might change over time; it is being written in Common Lisp, using literate programming in Emacs Org mode.

* Why Have Am I Doing This?
Mainly fun.

I've done some literate programming before, but only on a small scale (ie my Emacs config file), so there's that too.

* Is There Any Actual Use Case For This?
Probably not. As with most of what I program, it's more of a personal experiment.
