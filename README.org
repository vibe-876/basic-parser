* What is This?
This is one of my /many/ random projects that start from a "I wonder how hard this would be to do?"

The TL;DR is a parser for a basic language, but that might change over time; it is being written in Common Lisp.

** The Plan
1. Take some string s.
2. Split s at each space, to form a list l.
3. Iterate over l, running a cond over each item to find its purpose.
4. Return that new structure.

** Bits That I Haven't planned yet
Any of the small details on how to do this.

* Why Have Am I Doing This?
Mainly fun.
